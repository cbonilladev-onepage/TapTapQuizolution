# Create Your Own Quiz!

If you'd like to create your own quiz, you can do so by modifying three location:

1. **./data/quiz.js** => Adjust the JSON values to your liking. 
2. **./assets/\*** => Change the imported images. I created mine using https://carbon.now.sh/.
2. **./App.ts > const TOTAL_QUESTION = 10** => Adjust the amount of questions in the quiz. Simply expand the question base in the custom JSON file.
